<div class="pindent1">
<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0"><span class="smcap">The</span> City? Oh, yes, the City<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is a good enough place for a while,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It fawns on the clever and witty,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And welcomes the rich with a smile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">It lavishes money as water,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It boasts of its palace and hall,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the City is only the daughter&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Prairie is mother of all!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The City is all artificial,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its life is a fashion-made fraud,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its wisdom, though learned and judicial,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is far from the wisdom of God;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Its hope is the hope of ambition,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Its lust is the lust to acquire,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the larger it grows, its condition<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Sinks lower in pestilent mire.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">The City is cramped and congested,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The haunt and the covert of crime;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Prairie is broad, unmolested,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It points to the high and sublime;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span><span class="i0">Where only the sky is above you<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And only the distance in view,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With no one to jostle or shove you&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">It's there a man learns to be true!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where the breeze whispers over the willows<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or sighs in the dew laden grass,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the rain clouds, like big, stormy billows,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Besprinkle the land as they pass;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">With the smudge-fire alight in the distance,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The wild duck alert on the stream,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Where life is a psalm of existence<br /></span>
<span class="i1">And opulence only a dream.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Where wide as the plan of creation<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Prairies stretch ever away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And beckon a broad invitation<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To fly to their bosom, and stay;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The prairie fire smell in the gloaming&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The water-wet wind in the spring&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">An empire untrod for the roaming&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Ah, this is a life for a king!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">When peaceful and pure as a river<br /></span>
<span class="i1">They lie in the light of the moon,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">You know that the Infinite Giver<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Is stringing your spirit a-tune;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span><span class="i0">That life is not told in the telling,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That death does not whisper adieu,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And deep in your bosom up-welling,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">You know that the Promise is true!<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">To those who have seen it and smelt it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">To those who have loved it alone<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To those who have known it and felt it&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i1">The Prairie is ever their own;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And far though they wander, unwary,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Far, far from the breath of the plain,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A thought of the wind on the Prairie<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Will set their blood rushing again.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Then you to the City who want it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Go, grovel its gain-glutted streets,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Be one of the ciphers that haunt it,<br /></span>
<span class="i1">Or sit in its opulent seats;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But for me, where the Prairies are reaching<br /></span>
<span class="i1">As far as the vision can scan&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Ah, that is the prayer and the preaching<br /></span>
<span class="i1">That goes to the heart of a man!<br /></span>

<span class="i0">At the close of a thousand eons of sleep came a pang that was strange to me;<br /></span>

<span class="i0">Then I called him foes from the farthest north and the snowflake fluttered free;<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span><span class="i0">And the Sergeant said, "I'm a stranger here and I've driven a weary mile;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If you don't object I'll just sit down by the stove in the shack awhile."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So the Sergeant sat and smoked and talked of the home he had left down East,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the cold, and the snow, and the price of land, and the life of man and beast,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But all of a sudden he broke it off with, "Neighbors, take a nip?<br /></span>
<span class="i0">There's a horn of the best you'll find out there in my jumper, in the grip."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So one of the two went out for it, and as soon as he closed the door<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The other one staggered back as he gazed up the nose of a forty-four,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But the Sergeant wasted no words with him, "Now, fellow, you're on the rocks,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And a noise as loud as a mouse from you and they'll take you out in a box."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">So he fastened the bracelets to his wrists and his legs with some binder-thread,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And he took his knife and he took his gun and he rolled him onto the bed;<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span><span class="i0">And then as number two came in he said, "If you want to live,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Put up your dukes and behave yourself or I'll make you into a sieve."<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">And when he had coupled them each to each, and laid them out on the bed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">"It's cold, and I guess we'd better eat before we go," he said.<br /></span>
<span class="i0">So he fried some pork and he warmed some beans, and he set out the best he saw,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And they ate thereof, and he paid for it, according to British law.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That night in the post sat Sergeant Blue with paper and pen in hand,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And this is the word he wrote and signed and mailed to a foreign land:<br /></span>

<span class="i0">He hadn't breathed the prairie air more than a day or two<br /></span>

</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">Thus His <a href="#Lorship2">Lordship</a> grew suspicious that his "friends" would turn him down,<br /></span>

<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span><span class="i0">But he didn't know the message that was flashed along the wire<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To a simple country dealer in the land of his desire;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And it read: "Look out for Goggles, he'll be with you this a. m."<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the crowd around the station&mdash;well, he merely smiled to them,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And thought it jolly decent they'd assemble, don'tcherknow,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">The snow had fallen softly all the calm November night,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And they drove into the country for the most part of the day,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Until they reached a section that was flat and free from stone,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And the citizen remarked about a fellow he had known<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span><span class="i0">Who offered thirty dollars for this section in the fall,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But he finally consented, if His Lordship wouldn't tell<br /></span>
<span class="i0">That the price was forty dollars by the acre; this agreed,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A lawyer drew the papers and His Lordship got the deed,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And his heart was very happy as he smoked along the way<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Till the section burst upon them, and he scarce believed his sight,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">For the land lay in the sunshine, flashing back a snowy white . . . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And His Lordship stooped and felt it, and he heaved a little sigh,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As the knowledge dawned upon him that his land was&mdash;<i>alkali!</i><br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">His Lordship did some thinking as they journeyed back to town,<br /></span>

<span class="i0">(For the men from little England never know when they are licked),<br /></span>

<span class="i0">But the form that had sheltered me shivered, and seemed to shrivel away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I had raised it clear of my face I looked into lifeless clay. . . .<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And darkness fell, and the world was black, and the last of my reason fled,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when I came to myself again I was back at the ranch, in bed.<br /></span>
</div><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">That was back in the Eighties, and still I am living here;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I built this shanty on the spot; her grave is lying near;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And when at nights my nostrils sense the smoke-smell in the air<br /></span>
<span class="i0">I seem to feel her form again, and hear again her prayer;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And then the darkness settles down and wild night-creatures cry,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But stars come out in heaven and there's comfort in the sky.<br /></span>

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.net),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm

forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
